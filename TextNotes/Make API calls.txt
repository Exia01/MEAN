-Make a special folder for your service as good practice *per tony.*

- ng generate service namegoeshere *This is based on what you're doing like getting users. "Pokemon"

- Go into your app.models.ts  -> import {httpClientModule} from "@angular/commmon/http"

- assign to imports "HttpClientModule"

-import in that name services.ts {HttpClientModule} from "@angular/commmon/http"

-ensure the client is private - do that in all services *per Tony*

-procceed to create functions 
"findPokemon()" 

-for example if you're doing a get you should have the url parameter

-It will return an observable "i.e.., socket. 
-these have two options: 
you can subscribe and unsubscribe to them, and it takes a callback function. 

-In this instance you're passing the data that you subscribe to it and pass it to the find function.

-implement it by dependency inject in body components. 
 
- see line 2 PokemonService 


-line 15 ngoninit -essentially. Once we have the componets we want to talk to the service and we supply it the callback to obtain it. "data" 

we can also console.log that.

-if we refresh the main page and inspect it, and we notice that we should be receiving the data

- we can make a variable on line 13 

- we can then pass it onto line 19

-on the body componet we call it: 

{{pokemon.name}}

- we can also call a picture if there is on the object
<img src="{{pokemon.sprite.front_default}}
